This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe built using JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for playing the game against another player. The game follows the traditional rules of Tic-Tac-Toe, where players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid, with the objective of getting three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Features

- Player vs Player: Two players can play against each other on the same device.
- User Interface: Interactive and visually appealing game board.
- Win Detection: Automatically detects winning moves and declares the winner.
- Reset: Option to reset the game and start over.

## Usage

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The Tic-Tac-Toe game board will be displayed.

1. Player 1 starts by clicking on an empty cell to place their X mark.
2. Player 2 takes their turn by clicking on another empty cell to place their O mark.
3. Players continue taking turns until a player wins or the game ends in a draw.
4. If a player wins, a message will be displayed announcing the winner.
5. To play again, click the "Reset" button to clear the board and start a new game.
